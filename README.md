## Uni-Programming-Courses

This repository contains programming labs and assignments completed during my university studies.  
The work focuses on core concepts in software development, web technologies, and programming fundamentals, with an emphasis on practical, hands-on learning.

The labs were completed as part of the **Web Development programme** at **Karlstad University (KAU)**.  
The programme covers topics such as web development, programming, cloud services, and system development.
